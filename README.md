üëã Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio!

Data Scientist | Mathematician | Data Science Enthusiast

Hello! I'm a data scientist 
with a solid foundation in 
mathematics, data analytics, 
and machine learning, and I'm 
currently seeking a data science 
internship to apply my skills 
and grow in a dynamic environment. 
This GitHub repository contains a 
curated collection of my data 
science projects, demonstrating 
my technical skills, analytical 
thinking, and problem-solving 
abilities.

üìÇ Repository Overview

This repository features a 
selection of my projects that 
highlight my proficiency in 
various data science tools, 
machine learning techniques, 
and statistical analysis. 
Each project includes clear 
explanations, code documentation, 
and visualizations to provide 
insight into my approach and 
methods. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll 
find:

Featured Projects

1. Car Price Prediction
Tools: Python, Scikit-Learn,
Pandas, Matplotlib
Using machine learning models
like Linear Regression and
Random Forest, this project
predicts car prices based on
key features like fuel type,
transmission, and selling
price. I‚Äôve included metrics
such as Mean Squared Error,
RMSE, and R-squared to evaluate
model performance.

2. Email Spam Classification
Tools: Python, Multinomial
Naive Bayes, Gaussian Naive
Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes
This classification project
applies several Naive Bayes
models to distinguish between
spam and non-spam emails.
The project demonstrates my
experience in text processing
and classification model
evaluation.

3. Sales Prediction Based on Advertising
Tools: Python, Scikit-Learn,
Seaborn
Using data on advertisement
spending across TV, radio,
and newspapers, this project
aims to predict sales figures. The focus is on regression analysis and optimizing model accuracy.

4. Iris Flower Classification
Tools: Scikit-Learn,
Matplotlib
A classic project using
machine learning to classify
iris flowers based on petal
and sepal characteristics.
This project demonstrates my
understanding of supervised
learning and model validation.

5. Unemployment Analysis in India (2019-2020)
Tools: Python, Matplotlib,
Seaborn
A comprehensive analysis of
unemployment trends during
COVID-19. This project
highlights my skills in data
visualization, exploratory
data analysis, and drawing
insights from social and
economic data.

üåü Why Choose Me?

As a mathematically-inclined 
data scientist, I bring a 
unique blend of statistical 
rigor and analytical problem-solving 
to data science. 
I‚Äôm passionate about 
uncovering insights and 
trends from data and thrive 
in applying machine learning 
to real-world problems. 
My background in data science 
and hands-on projects, 
including [Data Science course with PORA Academy, Power BI course with AKEIF Academy, etc.],
positions me well for an 
internship that leverages my 
skills in data-driven decision-making.
